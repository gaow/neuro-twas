    "## Aim\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this pipeline is to build a prediction model for gene expression using cis-SNPs by obtaining \"weights\" from multiple regression of gene expression levels on SNP genotypes. The weights can then be combined with the GWAS data to test for association between predicted gene expression and GWAS phenotypes. Either GWAS summary statistics or GWAS genotype + phenotype data can be used for the association testing. "

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "__Objective__: \n",
    "    To Compute the association between expression and SNP for TWAS analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Background__:\n",
    "    SNP can modulate the functional phenotypes both directly and by modulating the expression levels of genes. \n",
    "Therefore, the integration of expression measurements and a larger scale GWAS summary association statistics will help identify the genes associated with the targeted complex traits. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Significance__:\n",
    "    By applying this method, new candidate genes whose expression level is significantly associated with complex traits can be used in prediction without actually going through the expensive gene expression measurement process. As a relatively small set of gene expression and genotyping, data can be used to impute the expression for a much larger set of phenotyped individuals from their SNP genotype data. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Method__:\n",
    "    The imputed expression can then be viewed as a linear model of genotypes with _weights based on the correlation between SNPs and gene expression__ in the training data while accounting for linkage disequilibrium (LD) SNPs. We then correlated the imputed gene expression to the trait to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) and identify significant expression-trait associations. \n",
    " \n",
    "The weights are computed via various models: blup, bslmm, lasso,top1, and enet. BLUP(best linear unbiased predictors)/bslmm(Bayesian linear mixed model) are conducted using gemma, lasso using plink, and enet (elastic net) using cv.glmnet function in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the weight calculation, the heritability of each gene are computed using GCTA; genes with insignificant heritability were screened out."
