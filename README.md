# twas-dev
Development code (private repo) for TWAS related multiomic gene-mapping in Alzheimer's disease data. Potential application of this project is to pinpoint SNPs that are regulating the disease phenotype both directly and via expression modulation and hence identify new targets for clinical genetics diagnostics and/or precision medicine. Ultimately we aim to transfer both the biological mechanism and analysis workflows to predict other complex trait based on both SNPs and the imputed gene expression.

Currently developing Pipeline for 
  RNA Seq Data transformation and QC
  Customized weight generation (Fusion-based)
  Expression imputation (Fusion-based)
